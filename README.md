# Delicious Creations

Our in-development webpage is named "Delicious Creations," catering to both food enthusiasts and culinary professionals. 
Our website offers users an array of services aimed at improving their culinary skills, fostering connections within the culinary industry, and delving into the world of cooking. 
We offer a diverse selection of seminars, including pastry making, baking, international cuisines, and more, all led by seasoned professionals.


!Please note that the features I am about to mention were not initially required by us; our primary goal was to enrich our app's overall experience.!

One noteworthy feature is the user's profile page, where they can proudly display the seminars they have completed. 
This feature turns their account into a dynamic portfolio, enabling potential collaborations with gastronomic companies to assess their skills and suitability.
